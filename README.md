## ðŸ’» Local Setup Guide

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/arifhassansky/roomify.git
cd roomify
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set up environment variables

To configure the backend services like Firebase and MongoDB, you'll need to set up environment variables. Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following:

```bash
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-firebase-api-key
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-firebase-auth-domain
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-firebase-project-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your-firebase-storage-bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your-firebase-messaging-sender-id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your-firebase-app-id
```

Make sure to replace your-* with actual credentials from your Firebase project.

### 4. Run the project

Once the dependencies are installed and environment variables are configured, you can run the project locally using:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser. You can now begin working with the Career Counseling Platform locally.
